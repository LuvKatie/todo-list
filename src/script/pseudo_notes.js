// 12 - 20 - 22

// Just finished fixing save functionality

// Move on to being able to edit Projects themselves with another popup modal

// Test adding deleting Projects first
// Test draw and drop re-arranging for Projects

// Final touches should be a drop-down menu filter for Project priority
// Nav bar should include a " Completed " section and " In Progress "

// Restyle the page to fit criteria aka have 1 main project showing and an " All Projects " tab on the left
// In THIs ^^^^ instance we might just create a separate HTML page for the Main landing page and redirect the " All Projects " link back to our current setup
// Swap index.html to the 1 main project page, and refactor the rest of our stuff so that our existing code DOM appends to a new html file titled "All-Projects"
// Could possibly do this with the other pages too
